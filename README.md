# MoonKnightForVectrex
Source code for the Moon Knight Vectrex Homebrew

While I consider this a finished project it still could use quite a bit of polishing

TODO:
Optimize text with a new font
Rotation of synced lists for a proper death animation instead of text
(Perhaps don't use synced lists at all)
Replace the large images with more simple graphics better suited to the Vectrex
Better sprites
Third enemy?
Scrolling barricades just like in Beany Bopper
