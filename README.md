# MoonKnightForVectrex
Source code for the Moon Knight Vectrex Homebrew

I know its not great. 
While I consider this a finished project it still could use quite a bit of polishing


TODO:
Optimize text with a new font

Rotation of synced lists for a proper death animation instead of text

- (Perhaps don't use synced lists at all)

Replace the large images with more simple graphics better suited to the Vectrex

Better sprites

Third enemy?

Scrolling barricades just like in Beany Bopper

Fix the scoring issue. Currently, killing an enemy grants 100 points regardless of being in frenzy or not.
